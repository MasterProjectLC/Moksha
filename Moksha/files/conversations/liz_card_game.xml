	<Jenna line="...Alright, so you've already played Support and Reinforcements. Which means... you either have Disruption or... Ambush, is that it?"/>
	<George line="That's right. Heh, you're already getting good at this!"/>
    <Jenna line="So, what to do, what to do..."/>
    <Narrator line="Jenna fixates on the game, running permutations through her head. Suddenly, this line of thought gets interrupted by someone approaching the table..."/>
    <Liz line="Excuse me, General?"/>
	<George line="Oh, hi, miss. How can this old aeronaut be of service today?"/>
    <Liz line="Well, umm... You're a friend of Albert, right? Albert Santos, I mean."/>
	<George line="Yeah, we go way back. Sam and I were both among the first to test some of the steam birds! He was just a boy back then, though. Have I already told you that story, Jenna?"/>
    <Jenna line="Yeah, uncle. Both you and dad."/>
	<George line="Oh, well, that's a bummer."/>
    <Liz line="So, umm, do you know where he is? Right now, I mean."/>
	<George line="Santos? Oh, he's probably off by the yoke doing some flying. From what I've heard, he'll only be back by lunch. Why, do you want to speak with him?"/>
    <Liz line="Yes, something of the sort. In any case, thank you for the information. I shall return to my room."/>
	<George line="Wait, miss? Now that you're here, why don't ya share a game with me and my niece? You'll have to wait one way or another."/>
    <Liz line="Well, I..."/>
	<Narrator line="She looks over to the table, cards placed on the wooden boards. Something seems to catch her eye."/>
    <Liz line="Is that... Is that a deck of Tatteln?"/>
	<Narrator line="Jenna turns to where the noblewoman is pointing. A single deck, moved to the side to accommodate the current game, resting on a forgotten corner of the table."/>
    <Jenna line="Yeah, it is. Do you wanna play it? Uncle and I, we're a bit rusty on the rules, but..."/>
    <Liz line="Sure, I do. Just like the General said, I'll have to wait one way or another. We can play a 3-player-variant my mother invented."/>
	<George line="Great! I'll prepare the deck."/>
