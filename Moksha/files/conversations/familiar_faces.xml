    <Narrator line="As the guests quietly vacate the lobby, Baxter and Magnus are left alone in the room."/>
    <Baxter line="So, Flettner, what did you think?"/>
    <Narrator line="Magnus pauses for a moment, seemingly confused about the question."/>
    <Magnus line="O-of what, Herr Blakewell?"/>
    <Baxter line="Heavens, Flettner, the presentation! How did it strike you?"/>
    <Magnus line="Oh, uh, I think it went quite well, sir. The facts were well presented, the main selling points were all mentioned..."/>
    <Baxter line="...That's a relief."/>
    <Magnus line="...but, well, I did notice something a bit..."/>
    <Baxter line="...odd?"/>
    <Magnus line="...strange. W-Well, odd, too."/>
    <Baxter line="Oh, jolly good. Then it wasn't just me. Was it, by chance, a familiar face?"/>
    <Magnus line="Y-Yes, exactly! At first, I wasn't so sure... As the guests boarded the ship, that woman with religious clothes... It was as if I met her somewhere before."/>
    <Narrator line="Baxter steps back."/>
    <Baxter line="Wait, woman?"/>
    <Magnus line="Y-Yes, isn't she the one you're talking about?"/>
    <Baxter line="I... no, nevermind. In any case... No, heavens, you wouldn't even know him."/>
    <Magnus line="Herr Blakewell..?"/>
    <Baxter line="Apologies, forget it. Willow did comment the trip was taking a toll on my paranoia... Perhaps I should clear my head."/>
    <Narrator line="An awkward silence creeps into the conversation. Magnus fidgets slightly."/>
    <Magnus line="Is... Is there anything else you need, sir?"/>
    <Narrator line="Baxter shakes his head."/>
    <Baxter line="No, that shall be all for now, doctor. I, er, thank you for coming down here and helping to deliver the presentation."/>
    <Magnus line="Oh, uh, you're welcome, sir. If it's in order with you, I shall take my leave."/>
    <Baxter line="Alright, you do that. I'll return to my room as well. Pip pip, Flettner."/>
    <Magnus line="Uh, pip pip, Herr Blakewell."/>
