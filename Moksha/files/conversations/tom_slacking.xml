    <Santos line="Hilda, mate! Tell Tom he ain't eating with the others tonight!"/>
    <Hilda line="What."/>
    <Santos line="Listen, I just caught him slacking off down at the dining hall. Talked smack to me, too. He needs to learn his lesson."/>
    <Narrator line="Hilda sighs, exasperated."/>
    <Hilda line="Are you sure you want to do that? He's only 17, Santos."/>
    <Santos line="Hilda, mate! Tell Tom he ain't eating with the others tonight!"/>
    <Hilda line="He's my SON, Hilda! I can't let him off doing whatever he pleases! Do you want him to grow up and become a weakling?"/>
    <Santos line="Alright, fine. I'll talk to him. But if he insists on saying no, I'm not going to force him. Deal?"/>
    <Hilda line="Deal. Loads o' thanks, doll."/>
