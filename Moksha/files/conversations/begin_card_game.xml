	<Jenna line="Hmm. Tough. I think I'll play... Blockade."/>
	<George line="Whu-! You have Blockade? Again?"/>
    <Jenna line="Well, you know me, uncle! I'm a lucky gal!"/>
    <Narrator line="George chuckles and smiles."/>
    <George line="Well, that's another thing you inherited from your old man, I guess. John always got away with those daring stunts of his... By the way, how's he doing these days?"/>
    <Jenna line="Oh, dad's fine. Maybe getting a bit old, heh. Just like you."/>
    <Narrator line="George raises an eyebrow, still smiling, in a mix of amusement and outrage."/>
    <George line="Old! Jenna, dear, George Hank Maybourne here doesn't get old, just... experienced, as one would say. Oh, and I play Ambush to remove your Blockade."/>
    <Jenna line="Damn..! Alright, uncle, we're playing for real, then. Let's see..."/>
    <Narrator line="Jenna squints her eyes on the cards, concentrating on her next move. Her uncle, meanwhile, shuffles on his chair, looking for a topic to fill the void."/>
    <George line="Anyway... I'm just glad we got to meet here of all places. Honestly, I was a bit worried I'd have to mingle with just a bunch of suits here for three days straight."/>
    <George line="I mean, Santos is fine, he was a pilot just like us, but Blakewell... if that's not the poster child for a boring fella, I don't know who is."/>
    <Jenna line="Aw, uncle, come on, he's not that bad. Have you seen him with his wife? They're adorable together."/>
    <George line="Adorable... really? Sheesh, I've got to see that one for my own damn self. I admit his miss is a gentle woman, but Blakewell... I only have the word 'cold' for him."/>
    <Jenna line="Well, I'm sure you'll change your mind eventually about him. Just like your Tank is changing theaters with my Maneuver!"/>
    <Narrator line="Jenna slaps the card on the table, revealing another sudden turnabout in that contested tug-of-war."/>
    <George line="Oh, fella. A Maneuver, at this point of the game? Huh, I think this general is all out of tricks, then."/>
    <Jenna line="Wait, really?! Then... YES, finally I beat-"/>
    <George line="Hahaha, just kidding, dear. I have another Maneuver to counter yours. You really are like your father, huh? Always rushing to the finish line!"/>
    <Jenna line="W-What? Aw, shucks. And here I thought beginner's luck would finally carry me to victory for once."/>
    <George line="Ah, don't get discouraged, Jenna. Me and your old man have played this for almost your entire lifetime. You're still just learning the ropes."/>
    <Jenna line="Yeah, it's alright. Card games were never my thing, anyway. Best of 5?"/>
    <George line="Already shuffling'em."/>
