description:
Amelie is a mysterious guest aboard the airship. An old, frail woman in her 70s, from both her apparent ethnicity and traditional clothing, it's safe to say that sheâ€™s some sort of indian religious figure - probably a monk. Her expression is distant, but her demeanor is gentle.\nWhy is she here and what does she want?
