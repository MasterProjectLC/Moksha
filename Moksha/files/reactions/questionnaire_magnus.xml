	<Magnus line="Oh, the questionnaire. Yes, I was the one who created it, under Baxter's request."/>
    <Elliot line="What sort of questions did you put in there?"/>
    <Magnus line="Mostly technical ones that related to aero-, thermo- and fluid dynamics, though they were also some focused on the business side of things. Those, in fact, were made by Herr Blakewell."/>
