	<Baxter line="Ah, yes, the infamous questionnaire. If you were wondering it, no, I wasn't the one who created it - I put up Flettner to do it."/>
    <Elliot line="If I may ask, sir, why did you create such a test in the first place?"/>
    <Baxter line="Aside from filtering out the tens or even hundreds of journalists trying to enter the airship? Well, one could say it was a combination of a publicity stunt and a declaration of our target market."/>
    <Baxter line="By announcing the questionnaire, we made sure that everyone who would be interested in our invention actually heard about it."/>
    <Elliot line="But only three people passed the test?"/>
    <Baxter line="Maybourne, Renard and Bhattacharya, you mean? No, they were not the only ones. More guests are expected further down in the voyage."/>
    <Elliot line="Oh, I see."/>
