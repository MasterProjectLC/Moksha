	<Santos line="That's my boy, Tom! I'm honestly surprised you even noticed him."/>
    <Elliot line="If I may ask, why did you put him up to work as a crewman?"/>
    <Santos line="Ah, yes, well, Tom needed some sweat, ya know? Too much time solving puzzles, not enough lifting weights. If he wants to become more like his pa, I reckon he has to earn it."/>
