	<Baxter line="..Yes? What did you say?"/>
    <Elliot line="The Medusa, sir. Could you talk more about it?"/>
    <Baxter line="Ah, right. Well, Dr. Flettner would be better equipped to discuss its technical details, but if you'd like more information for your report, I'll indulge."/>
    <Baxter line="Hm, let's seeâ€¦ The Medusa is an aerial vessel capable of carrying up to 200 thousand kilograms. While designed to be a passenger cruiser, it is also equipped to function as a cargo ship or even a military unit."/>
    <Baxter line="Its current price tag hangs around 2 million pounds. A passenger ticket, in turn, is estimated to cost around 360 pounds."/>
    <Baxter line="As such, we're marketing it towards mostly aeronautical enthusiasts, high society members and great entrepreneurs. Is there anything else you need?"/>
    <Elliot line="No, that will be all, sir. Thank you."/>
