	<George line="That's Santos' son, Thomas. I never talked to the boy directly, but Santos commented about him a couple of times."/>
    <George line="From what he says, Thomas, or 'Tom', like he calls him, is a bit of a weakling compared to his old man. Not only that, but it seems he's going through a rebellious phase, too."/>
    <George line="A bit weird that he's working as a crewman, though, don't ya think? Santos must be probably trying to straight him up that way."/>
