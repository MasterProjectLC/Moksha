	<Hilda line="Oh, that's Tom. Santos' son. Yes, I know how it sounds."/>
    <Elliot line="H-How it sounds?"/>
    <Hilda line="It sounds cruel, doesn't it? A 17-year-old boy working with men twice his age, crushed under stress, inexperience and bottled-up rage."/>
    <Elliot line="When you put it like that, yes, I agree..."/>
    <Hilda line="Well, the one who asked for it was Tom himself. I mean, partially. Santos threw the bait, and Tom bit it."/>
    <Elliot line="Huh... Why do you think he did that?"/>
    <Hilda line="Me? I think Tom's trying to prove something. Maybe to his father, maybe to himself. Over and over I gave him chances to rest and stop, but he wouldn't. It would be impressive, if it wasn't so damn idiotic."/>
