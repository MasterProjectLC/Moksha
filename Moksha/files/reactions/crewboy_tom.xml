	<Tom line="Yep, that's me. My father fucking decided to put me here, so here I am."/>
    <Elliot line="I assume 'no' wasn't a possible answer..?"/>
    <Tom line="W-Well, I mean- not really. Not without looking like a fucking weakling to him."/>
    <Elliot line="I wouldn't say refusing to work under such terrible conditions is a sign of weakness..."/>
    <Tom line="Hah, well, that's what most people think. Most people are weak - no offense. And I don't want to become like 'most people'."/>
    <Tom line="My father might be an idiot and an asshole, but he's certainly not weak. And if I... if I... if I want to beat himâ€¦ then I need to work even harder than him."/>
