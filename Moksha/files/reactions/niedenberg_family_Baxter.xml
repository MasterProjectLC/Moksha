    <Baxter line="Oh, that's Willow's family. Austro-Hungarian noble blood, from what I've gathered. As a matter of fact, I've already talked to her parents, once. It was an unpleasant conversation."/>
    <Elliot line="Oh, really? How?"/>
    <Baxter line="Well, they're nobles. Old money. They don't care for people like me, the nouveau riche, who made the money themselves. It seems they find us... too inconspicuous."/>
    <Elliot line="What about Willow? Or Liz?"/>
    <Baxter line="Ah, Willow is different. Fortunately she left that den of eagles to pursue her own dreams. Liz, on the other hand... she still has the same antiquated mindset."/>
    <Elliot line="I see..."/>
