    <Willow line="I... don't really talk to my family anymore. I 'left the coop', as Bax would put it. But I'm trying to get back in touch!"/>
    <Elliot line="Was it you who invited Liz to this voyage?"/>
    <Willow line="Yes, it was. She resents me for leaving, but deep down, I know we can still make amends."/>
    <Elliot line="Why does she resent you?"/>
    <Willow line="It's... complicated. I wouldn't be comfortable sharing her reasons to others, as it's something very personal to her. It wouldn't be right."/>
    <Elliot line="I understand. Thank you, Ms. Blakewell."/>
